# STEP ONE - CREATE A VECTOR DATABASE TO HOLD THE DATA

Supabase > new project

Add vector extension...

In the SQL Editor: choose New SQL Snippet (Execute SQL Queries)

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS extensions;

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector WITH SCHEMA extensions;
```

(In theory you could also throw it into the public schema but security best practice is to put it in a private schema)

Create a new table

Create this under the 'public' schema
You have to do this with another SQL command.

I prefer to use the interface for something like this, but it doesn't let you specify vector size.

We're going to need the following columns:

- id (bigserial)
- created_at (timestamp, default to now() - may be useful later if expanding the list)
- name (string)
- hex (string)
- is_good_name (boolean, default false)
- embedding_small vector(1536)
- embedding_large vector(3072)

We will need an index for the embedding column that we end up searching on, but we'll get better performance if we add that AFTER we've populated the table with data.

So here's the SQL:

```sql
create table public.colors (
id bigserial primary key,
created_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
name text not null unique,
hex text,
is_good_name boolean default false,
embedding_small vector(1536),
embedding_large vector(3072)
);
```

If you get a security warning about Row Level Security, so we enable that on the table.

Then click "Add RLS Policy". I just use the Templates to say Enable read access for all users.

# STEP TWO - PULL IN THE SOURCE DATA

The source data is in this excellent project here:

https://github.com/meodai/color-names/blob/main/src/colornames.csv

Easy route: just copy paste.

Sidequest: I want to pull in the color list in a way that will make easier to pull in future updates.

To sync first time:

```sh
git remote add canonical-color-list https://github.com/meodai/color-names.git
git fetch canonical-color-list
git checkout canonical-color-list/main -- src/colornames.csv
git add src/colornames.csv
git commit -m "Adding canonical color list from meodai/color-names"
git push origin main
```

To update later:

```sh
git fetch canonical-color-list
git checkout canonical-color-list/main -- src/colornames.csv
git commit -m "Update colornames.csv from meodai color-names"
git push
```

# STEP THREE - WRITE A SCRIPT TO TURN THE SOURCE DATA INTO DB-READY DATA

I'm going to use JavaScript.

First I write an integration with OpenAI...

Then I write a super simple script that calls that

script.ts

```ts
import { clientOpenai } from "./clientOpenai";

const getEmbedding = async (inputText: string) => {
  const embedding = await clientOpenai.embeddings.create({
    model: "text-embedding-3-small",
    input: inputText,
    encoding_format: "float",
  });
  return embedding.data[0].embedding;
};

const testRun = async () => {
  const embedding = await getEmbedding("red");
  console.log(embedding);
  console.log(embedding.length);
};

testRun();
```

To run this, I use bun. So the Terminal command is:

```sh
bun src/script.ts
```

Next, I integrate Supabase.

To do this you'll need your Project ID (find this on Settings > General > Project Settings).

It will look something like this: "abcdefghijklmnopqrst"

Your .env file will need a SUPABASE_URL, which will look something like this:

"https://abcdefghijklmnopqrst.supabase.co"

Your SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is a longer string that you'll find in Settings > API Keys > Reveal.

Here's the code:

```ts
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";
import { Database } from "../types/supabase";

const supabaseUrl = process.env.SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseKey = process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY;

if (!supabaseUrl || !supabaseKey) {
  throw new Error("SUPABASE_URL or SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is not set");
}

export const clientSupabase = createClient<Database>(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);
```

To create that types/supabase file, you'll need to...

1. Create a types folder
2. Install Supabase: `npm i supabase`
3. Login to Supabase CLI: `npx supabase login`
4. Follow the login flow in your browser
5. Generate TypeScript types: `npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id abcdefghijklmnopqrst > types/supabase.ts`

Now we have our supabase client created, we want to save color entries to it. There's a bit of data prep here...

- the vector must be passed in as a string
- we want to respect the uniqueness of the name, so we should do an upsert rather than insert

And the result is:

```ts
type PreppedColor = {
  name: string;
  hex: string;
  is_good_name: boolean;
  embedding_small: string;
};

const saveColorEntry = async (preppedColor: PreppedColor) => {
  const { error } = await clientSupabase
    .from("colors")
    .upsert(preppedColor, { onConflict: "name" });
  if (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } else {
    console.log("Saved color entry", preppedColor.name);
  }
};
```

In my code I'm making sure to strip the hash character out of the color values, but that's a personal preference.

I've also added in time delays just in case.

# STEP FOUR - ADD A VECTOR INDEX TO THE DATABASE

The command you will want to run looks something like this:

```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY colors_embedding_small_idx
on public.colors
using ivfflat (embedding_small vector_cosine_ops)
with (lists = 100);
```

**ivfflat** = An index method optimized for high-dimensional vector data. It divides vectors into clusters for faster searching. Alternatives would be hnsw (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) which can be faster but uses more memory.

**vector_cosine_ops** = Operator class that uses cosine similarity for comparing vectors. Alternatives are vector_l2_ops (Euclidean distance) and vector_ip_ops (inner product), but cosine similarity is generally best for semantic search.

**lists** = Number of clusters to divide the vectors into. Rule of thumb is sqrt(n)/2 where n is number of rows - so for 30k rows, sqrt(30000)/2 â‰ˆ 87, rounded up to 100 for simplicity. More lists = faster search but less accurate.

HOWEVER - you may hit the problem I hit, which was that the working memory needed is higher than the default Supabase limits, and can't be increased via the interface.

This meant I needed to connect to the database via Terminal.

If you haven't done this before you'll need to install Postrgres on your machine. For macOS using brew the command is:

```sh
brew install postgresql
```

Then connect in to the database with this command:

psql "host=aws-0-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com dbname=postgres user=postgres.abcdefghijklmnopqrst"

Where...

- us-east-2 is the datacentre you chose when setting up your project
- abcdefghijklmnopqrst is your Project Id
- you'll be prompted for a password, it's the password you gave when you first set up the database

Once connected to the database by command line, you can run this code.

```sql
SET maintenance_work_mem = '128MB';

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY colors_embedding_small_idx
on public.colors
using ivfflat (embedding_small vector_cosine_ops)
with (lists = 100);
```

(yes you might expect to be able to run this directly via Supabase CLI, but the index creation cannot run inside a transaction block, so...you can't)

UH OH... Supabase won't let us crank up working memory within their interface

Which means we need to do it via CLI

# STEP FIVE - CREATE AN RPC FUNCTION TO CALL THAT VECTOR INDEX FROM CODE

Usually when you want to call this DB from code you'll use the supabase SDK, and that will have predefined functions to let you add, delete, update etc.

Calling the vector index seems to be beyond the scope of the current SDK, so we'll need to create our own custom function that we can call in a controlled way.

This is called an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) Function.

For our needs, we're going to want to query the embedding column, and get ten results back with name, hex, and is_good_name fields. Interestingly we don't need to name the index we're calling, as there's only one for that column.

Here's the code:

```sql
create or replace function query_embedding_small(
  query_embedding vector(1536),
  match_count int default 10
)
returns table (
  name text,
  hex text,
  is_good_name boolean,
  distance float
)
language sql volatile
as $$
  set statement_timeout = 15000;

  set ivfflat.probes = 5;

  select
    name,
    hex,
    is_good_name,
    embedding_small <#> query_embedding as distance
  from colors
  order by distance
  limit match_count;
$$;
```

Some explanations:

statement_timeout - How long (in ms) before a timeout on calling this function. Default is around 8-10 seconds, I've bumped to 15 seconds here.

ivfflat probes - This sets how many IVF lists the index will scan during search. Higher values = more accurate results but slower queries. Default is 1, we're setting to 10 for better accuracy at cost of some speed.

language sql volatile - This tells Postgres that this is a SQL function that can modify data and its output may change even with the same inputs. 'volatile' means the function's result can vary even if called with identical parameters. This is required if we want to use a non-default number of ivfflat probes.

# STEP SIX - RUN A TEST QUERY

```ts
const testQuery = async () => {
  const testEmbedding = await getEmbedding(
    "milky coffee in the middle of the night"
  );

  const { data, error } = await clientSupabase.rpc("query_embedding_small", {
    query_embedding: JSON.stringify(testEmbedding),
    match_count: 10,
  });

  if (error) {
    console.error("RPC error:", error);
  } else {
    console.log("Matches:", data);
  }
};
```

# STEP SEVEN - ADD IN ALL THE DATA

At this point I added in all 30,000 entries at this point.

It took about 8 hours.

Good news: It cost me $0.02 of API costs for the embedding values.
Bad news: It pushed me over the database size limits on Supabase...

# STEP EIGHT - UPGRADE SUPABASE

30,000 entries with vectors plus an index plus RPC function results in a database size of 0.53 GB, and the free tier limit is 0.5 GB.

If i had known this I might have only used 90% of the data, but I didn't so I've moved up to Pro plan size.

# STEP NINE - SOLVE TIMEOUTS

At this point I started getting this message:

```json
RPC error: {
code: "57014",
details: null,
hint: null,
message: "canceling statement due to statement timeout",
}
```

Here's what I did to solve this:

## 1 - Run ANALYZE (just once)

```
ANALYZE public.colors;
```

PostgreSQL scans a sample of rows in the public.colors table and updates its internal statistics about the data. These stats help the query planner decide how to execute queries efficiently â€” for example, whether to use an index or not.

## 2 - Decrease the number of IVFFLAT probes

In IVFFlat indexing, a higher probes value makes queries slower but more accurate.

## 3 - Increase the timeout time in the RPC function

Aka cheating. When I bumped the timeout to 30000ms all my problems went away.

## Other options that I did NOT need, but you might

- Recreate the index with a higher `lists` value (this only works if your querying with a `probes` that is much lower than the index's number of `lists`)
- Add a catch-and-retry in my server code. The second request always seems to be faster so there must be some warm-up logic or internal caching happening on Supabase
- Create my own cache of recent results in something like Redis
